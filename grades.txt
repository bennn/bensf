Why was transition to Cornell as a sophomore hard?
- Not excited once I arrived in ILR
- Tried keeping close ties to Albany (including girlfriend; we split after 1.5 years at Cornell)
- Lived off-campus. Saved money, but my friends were older and not in my program
- Worked part-time (~20 hrs/week as a custodian).
- Was very worried about future; had been arrested (youthful offender) for skateboarding and that was all very messy for a while.

TBH, I never felt part of the cornell community until I started working for 3110.
Thanks Nate!
