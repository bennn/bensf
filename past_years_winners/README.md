past_years_winners
===

Data on NSF GRFP awardees over the past decade collected from the [NSF Awardee List](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList).
I was most interested in the number of computer science winners.
The `NUM MALE` and `NUM FEMALE` columns of `results.tab` are pure speculation.
